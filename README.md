## Description
**RSA_IP**

- Introduction
RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission, and is also one of the oldest. The acronym “RSA” comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. The intention is that messages encrypted with public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time by using the private key. Since the process of encryption and decryption use different keys, the RSA cryptosystem is also known as asymmetric cryptosystem.
